// Add character limit to PlanItem titles

// Delete buttons call removal method and deletes from DOM

// The add plan button calls up a form, submitting the form instantiates a new Plan object and populates the sidebar with it

// The newly created 'plan' buttons on the sidebar will populate the display with the corresponding object's data 
// That object's display will have an 'add item' button that will open a form that submits and creates a new item object
// The subsequent item button will populate the display and have a few functional buttons to edit the corresponding item object and change the DOM values
